## arkanoid

This arkanoid is based on quintus.
It is cloned from [Breakouts](https://github.com/city41/breakouts) project.

I add some features.
- Blocks now have HP : blue=1, orange=2, red=3, green=4, gray=unbreakable.
- performance tunning : remove sounds, simplify sprites and clearRect logic.

It also uses MIT licensed.
